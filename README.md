End-to-end SQL project using a retail dataset to uncover powerful sales and customer insights. Built from DDL creation to advanced window functions, stored procedures, triggers, and KPIs. Includes YoY, MoM, WoW, QoQ growth analysis, ranking logic, and customer/product segmentation. Showcases advanced SQL skills## üéØ Objective / Problem Statement

To explore, analyze, and optimize retail operations using advanced SQL techniques ‚Äî from customer trends to product profitability and time-based performance tracking.


## üìä Dataset Description

- **Source**: Retail sales data with fields like `order_date`, `ship_date`, `product`, `customer`, `region`, `sales`, `profit`, and more.
- Contains multiple years of transaction data, suitable for growth and performance analysis.
- Structured into normalized form and enhanced with temporal and business dimensions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL (MySQL)**
- **Window Functions (RANK, NTILE, FIRST_VALUE, etc.)**
- **CTEs, Triggers, Stored Procedures**
- **Lag/Lead Analysis**
- **GitHub (Version Control & Collaboration)**


## üîç Key Tasks Performed

- Full schema design with DDL statements
- Created KPIs: Sales, Profit, Quantity, YoY/MoM/WoW growth
- Applied window functions for ranking, trends, and segmentation
- Used subqueries, CTEs, and joins for deep insights
- Built cumulative, moving average, and time series views
- Identified high-value customers, top states, fast vs slow shipping, etc.



## üìà Key Insights / Findings

- üîù **Top Customers** and Manufacturers ranked by sales and profit
- ‚è≥ **Shipping Efficiency** analyzed by state
- üìà **YoY, MoM, and WoW growth** calculated across all time units
- üéØ **Repeat buyer patterns** and seasonal buying behavior discovered
- üßÆ **Sales quartiles and rank-based performance** for customers/products
- üóÉÔ∏è **Customer/product profitability ratios** for targeted strategies
- 

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Role / Contribution

- Designed database structure from scratch (DDL to DML)
- Authored 80+ SQL queries with performance and logic optimization
- Applied real-world use cases to each analysis point
- Created reusable patterns for trend and segmentation analysis
- Built the logic to be adaptable for enterprise data warehouse use

## üí° Business Recommendations

- üéØ Focus marketing on top quartile customers based on sales trend
- üöõ Improve shipping times in identified slow-performing states
- üí∞ Promote high SP_ratio (sales-to-profit) products aggressively
- üìÜ Plan inventory based on monthly and weekly sales fluctuation
- üîÅ Encourage repeat buys from stable loyal segments
- üìâ Identify and discontinue underperforming SKUs and sub-categories

> ‚≠ê This project reflects not just SQL query writing but business understanding, logic design, and analytical sharpness.
